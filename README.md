## 🌌 Why ExposiGuard Exists

We live immersed in invisible constellations of electromagnetic signals — WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular, ambient noise — yet most of us have no idea how much our bodies absorb or how these exposures evolve over time. **ExposiGuard** was born from a simple realization: *we deserve to know*.

This app is a poetic and technical response to a world saturated with signals. It empowers users to monitor their environment, protect their privacy, and make informed decisions — all without sacrificing autonomy or exposing personal data.

Whether you're curious, cautious, or cultivating a low-EMF lifestyle, ExposiGuard offers clarity in the noise.
